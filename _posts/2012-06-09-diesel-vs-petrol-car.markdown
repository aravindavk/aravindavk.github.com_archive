Since Diesel cars are expensive than Petrol cars, it is very difficult to decide which car is best suited for my usage. I searched in google to find the answer and asked many friends and relatives, but still couldn't decide because of too much information :) 

So started creating a simple online tool to analyze and decide which car is economical based on my planned usage. Click [here](http://aravindavk.github.com/diesel-vs-petrol-car/) to use the tool online.

Note: This comparison doesn't include maintanance cost of the vehicle, and the variation in fuel prices. 

Let me know if you find this tool useful. If you are interested in modifying the functionality then source code is [here](https://github.com/aravindavk/aravindavk.github.com/tree/master/diesel-vs-petrol-car). Enjoy!
